### Adaptive capacity of coral populations
The importance of ecological and evolutionary processes in population persistence has been well-explored in marine and terrestrial systems, yet few studies have considered the effects of both components simultaneously. In this project, I'm quantifying the contribution of competition, dispersal, and directional selection on the potential for coral populations to adapt and persist under increasing thermal stress. In addition to these processes, I'm using a graph theoretic approach to address questions regarding the role of network structure on coral adaptive potential.

### Resilience across the Coral Triangle
The Coral Triangle in the Indo-Pacific is the center of marine biodiversity and is also one of them most vulnerable to the effects of our shifting climate. Here, I am applying a coral-algal competition model to a system composed of thousands of reefs to assess the factors that underly coral population sensitivty to thermal stress. Can larval dispersal mitigate the effects of rising temperatures in the Coral Triangle?

### Population genetics of Acroporid corals
The spatial scales that capture ecologically relevant dispersal in reef-building corals is an open question. In my models, I frequently use estimates of coral connectivity derived from ocean circulation model outputs and passive particle tracking. To obtain empirical dispersal distances of dominant reef builders in the Indo-Pacific, I collected over 600 tissue samples of <i>Acropora tenuis</i> and <i>Acropora vermiculata</i>. These coral samples were taken from sites across Cebu and Leyte in the central Philippines. To inform ecological models and conservation efforts in the area, I am using ddRAD sequencing to quantify the spatial scales over which these coral populations exchange larvae.
