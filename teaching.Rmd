<span style="font-size:1.5em;"> MBIO 610 - Mathematical Ecology of Marine Systems</span>
<br>
This 3-week intensive course will next be offered in January 2023.
<br>

**Schedule:** This is an intensive, 12-session course with a hybrid schedule (i.e., partially in-person and partially online). 
<br>

**Description:** This course introduces a broad range of theories and techniques from mathematical ecology with an emphasis on marine systems. Students will learn to assess model assumptions, construct simple models, and apply analytical methods to describe system behavior. The course contains a combination of lectures, computer labs, and student-led primary literature discussions. Topics covered include density-independent vs. density-dependent population growth, stage-structured populations, competition, predation, metapopulations, harvesting, infectious disease, and ecological regime shifts. The course will culminate with students conducting a final ecological modeling project of their own design.
