## Nonlinear Coral Reef Dynamics: Linking Modeling & Empirical Approaches

This is the [course website](https://lmcmanus47.github.io/course_syllabus) for "Nonlinear Coral Reef Dynamics: Linking Modeling & Empirical Approaches" at the [University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu) in the [Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology ](http://www.himb.hawaii.edu). Dr. [Lisa McManus](https://lmcmanus47.github.io) is the instructor.

**Summer II 2021: July 6 - August 13**

**Location**: HIMB (Lecture and Labs)

**Schedule**: *Lecture*-TR 9-10:40AM (7/6/21-8/12/21) | *Lab*-R 12:00-5:00PM

**Prerequisites**: 1 year of Calculus

**Readings**: This course will use a combination of the primary literature and the textbook Population Biology: Concepts and Models by Alan Hastings.

## Course description

In this course, I will introduce you to a broad range of theories and techniques from mathematical ecology, with a particular emphasis on examples from coral reef systems. There will be a programming component using Python that will focus on computational approaches to simulate dynamical systems. We will also conduct reef surveys in Kaneohe Bay in order to link theoretical frameworks with field data. The course will be centered on live-coding activities, pen & paper mathematical analyses (e.g., linear stability analysis & eigenvalues) and collaborative group work. 

## Course assessment
